 UNIX BUILD NOTES


Dependencies
------------
Libraries you need to obtain separately to build:

              default path   download
wxWidgets      \wxwidgets     http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
OpenSSL        \openssl       http://www.openssl.org/source/
Berkeley DB    \db            http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/index.html
Boost          \boost         http://www.boost.org/users/download/

Their licenses:
wxWidgets      LGPL 2.1 with very liberal exceptions
OpenSSL        Old BSD license with the problematic advertising requirement
Berkeley DB    New BSD license with additional requirement that linked software must be free open source
Boost          MIT-like license

Versions used in this release:
GCC          4.3.3

Notes
-----
The UI layout is edited with wxFormBuilder.  Open the project file
uiproject.fbp.  It generates uibase.cpp and uibase.h, which define base
classes that do the rote work of constructing all the UI elements.


wxWidgets
---------
cd /usr/local/wxWidgets-2.8.9
mkdir buildgtk
cd buildgtk
../configure --with-gtk --enable-debug --disable-shared --enable-monolithic
make
su
make install
ldconfig


OpenSSL
-------
cd /usr/local/openssl-0.9.8k
./config
make
make test
su
make install

  [todo: try no-everything config]


Berkeley DB
-----------
cd /usr/local/db-4.7.25.NC/build_unix
../dist/configure --enable-cxx
make


Boost
-----
cd /usr/local/boost_1_40_0
su
./bootstrap.sh
./bjam install
